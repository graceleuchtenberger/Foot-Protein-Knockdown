# Foot Protein Knockdown

I'm interested in using siRNA to knock down _Mytilus galloprovincialis_ foot protein 3 (Mgfp-3), a foot protein that is part of the mussel's byssal thread plaque, and then measuring strength of attachment. Gene expression will also be used to assess strength of the knockdown.

As of 6/30: Working on designing primers and the siRNA from IDT, will order after the financial switch. Going to gain byssal thread testing experience on the thread quality pilot.
